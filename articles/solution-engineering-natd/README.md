# Solution Engineering: Oracle Cloud Solution Hubs Interviews

***Note:*** This document is best viewed by clicking on this [github.io link](https://ksantosh464.github.io/Solution-Engineering/articles/solution-engineering-natd/index.html)


## The Role
Solutions Engineering is more BREADTH than depth. You take the products that have already been built, extend them with your coding skills and integrate them with other products, thereby building a **solution**. **This is primarily a technical job** with client interactions, and we are looking for good communications and business acumen. We are a **customer-facing** organization.

In order to be a successful solution engineer, you should possess the following traits:
* Strong technical skills (coding, software development, problem solving).
* Good communication skills - you don’t build solutions for yourself; you build them for customers and the **real world**. You also need to be able to communicate the technical details and business value of the solutions you build.
* Desire to push yourself to understand technology. You must have drive and motivation to always be curious, continually learning and applying what you learn.
* You must have the ability to work under tight deadlines - our projects can be 2-6-weeks long, and most of them are directly driven by our customers' desire to see what is possible in the Oracle Cloud.
* Desire to collaborate and innovate, be open to other ideas, inclusive in a team setting, and to create customer-relevant solutions.

## Interview Process

The face-to-face interview process is a technical interview outlined below:

## Technical Presentation and Demo - up to 45 minutes

| Interview Section | Minutes | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overview | 3 - 5 | Brief overview of yourself, covering your technical skills and experience |
| Journey to Cloud Presentation | 15 | Brief overview of Oracle's cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud |
| Tech Deep Dive: Project Highlight or Oracle Cloud Demo | 15 | Overview of a development project on which you have recently worked OR a brief demo on Oracle Cloud built using a [free Oracle Cloud Account](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit?sourceType=:ad:pas:go:aw:db:RC_WWMK180328P00048C0001&SC=:ad:pas:go:aw:db:RC_WWMK180328P00048C0001&pcode=WWMK180328P00048C0001&&mkwid=sxCyDKsb2%7cpcrid%7c263478509230%7cpkw%7cautonomous%20database%7cpmt%7ce%7cpdv%7cc%7csckw=srch:autonomous%20database&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpsPRn5L_3QIVy0oNCh3nAQ3rEAAYAiAAEgIm5PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) |  
| Technical Q & A Interview | 10 | Technical Question and Answer Interview - Expect to be asked about projects where you were a MAJOR contributor |

## Overview

During this presentation, provide a brief overview of yourself, including your technical experience and skills. It's not necessary to go into detail, as we will ask more questions during the **Technical Question and Answer Interview** section of the interview.

## Journey to Cloud: Presentation

The scenario for the presentation is one where you need to present a technical/business overview of Oracle’s Cloud platform to a potential customer that is interested in making the journey to the cloud. Assume the customer audience consists of technical and business-level attendees. This customer is interested in moving to the cloud but is not sure whether it is the right move and whether Oracle is the right vendor. It is important to address both the business value and the technical value of the proposed solution.

This **presentation** should be no longer than <u>**15 minutes**</u> and can be based on the content found in the links provided below. A [PowerPoint deck is available at this link](FY20_Candidate_Cloud_Presentation.pptx). You do not have to use this specific presentation so feel free to customize it.  We suggest that you use your own words in presenting the slides.

Key focus areas:
- Expect your audience to ask for clarification on any content you show and **actively interrupt you**.
- Make sure you know the differences between DaaS, SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.
- Please Do NOT read out of your notes.  

Below are some links to study Oracle’s Cloud platform, yet feel free to use other resources as well:

## Touch the Cloud: Oracle Cloud Research and Demo

![Touch The Cloud](./images/Touch-the-Cloud.jpg)

In this portion of the interview, you will select **a single option** from the 2 options below. **Remember: You only have 15 minutes**

### **Option 1: Recent Project Presentation**
If you use PowerPoint to start, please limit your presentation to approximately 3 Slides.

**Guidelines for Project Walkthrough**
- How did you get involved in this project?  We prefer an individual project OR a team project that is not coursework-related.
- How big was the team (if there was one)?
- What was your specific role and contribution (e.g, I coded front-end and collected requirements for project OR I coded some piece of the front-end)? We are looking for "I" not "WE."
- Walk through the code (whatever the code may be - this could be methods you may have written, or if you used R-Studio, show us what you did in R).
	- Any libraries you used or didn’t use
	- Any coding challenges
	- Was any DevOps process used?
	- Is there a GitHub repo where we can look at this code?

### **Option 2: Demo Using Oracle Cloud Account**

Please follow [this link](https://cloud.oracle.com/tryit?sourceType=:ad:pas:go:aw:db:RC_WWMK180328P00048C0001&SC=:ad:pas:go:aw:db:RC_WWMK180328P00048C0001&pcode=WWMK180328P00048C0001&&mkwid=sxCyDKsb2%7cpcrid%7c263478509230%7cpkw%7cautonomous%20database%7cpmt%7ce%7cpdv%7cc%7csckw=srch:autonomous%20database&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpsPRn5L_3QIVy0oNCh3nAQ3rEAAYAiAAEgIm5PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) to sign up for a free Oracle trial account.

**Expectations:**

- Demonstrate your ability to learn Oracle’s Cloud services.
- Provide us with critical feedback if there were roadblocks.
- Build out a simple solution/product/project leveraging one or more Oracle Cloud services.  While we would like to see a finished product (even if it is simple), we are more interested in your approach to building things out.

**Cloud Services Suggestions  (Feel free to try more than one if you have time):**

- Use an IAAS compute instance and may be MySQL instance to create a 3 or 2-tier web app.  
- Look at data sets from Kaggle or other areas in public domain, leveraging REST APIs from popular non-Oracle cloud services (Maps, Twitter, Instagram, Dropbox, Box etc.)  
- Use any programming language of your choice while coding. Python, Java, Node.js, React.js, i.e. anything that you are comfortable with.
- Use Oracle Analytics Cloud and create visualizations
- It's always good practice to create a quick video of your work -just in case you run into issues.
- To net this out, even if you are unable to get something deployed in our Cloud, we will review the effort that you made.

## Technical Question and Answer Interview

During this section of the interview we will ask technical questions based on your experience and our requirements of the Solution Engineering position. We hope to gain a better understanding of your development expertise, your understanding of development methodologies, and your experience with various programming languages and open source tools and frameworks.

## Visual Aids

- The interview room will be furnished with a whiteboard and laptop that you can use to present your Journey to Cloud and Touch the Cloud Presentations.
- Oracle Supplied Laptop: For in-person interviews, we will have a laptop and projector available for your use. The laptop will have connectivity to the internet, and you can bring a USB drive if you desire to load a presentation to the laptop.
- For remote interviews, please be prepared with Webex software pre-installed and ready to use on your computer. You can test your device’s Webex readiness here: https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html
